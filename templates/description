This project aims to help the blind people. They can use this web application to know the objects in front of them. With the help of this application, they donâ€™t need expensive physical devices. Blind people encounter many difficulties in moving from one place to another, i.e., navigation. Vision is the power that enables a person to see obstacles in his path. Our device detects objects in the person's environment for assistance.
DRISTHI, as the name indicates, will act as a third eye for blind people.
